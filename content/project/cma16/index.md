I had to bring helpdesk support for ~50 people about hardware (for instance, printers :sweat:), business softwares, OS, etc. Next, I was in charge to maintain networks and servers<!--more-->
It was a great opportunity to learn how a network works with servers (OSI model, proxy, print server, DHCP, <abbr title="Terminal Server">TS</abbr>, backups, etc.). During my mission, I'm proud to have changed the entire IP address plan in order to connect all services.
